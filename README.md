## TASK DESCRIPTION

For the first task of my internship under CodTech IT Solutions, I developed an interactive quiz application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project was to create a fully functioning quiz system that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback, and view their final score at the end of the quiz. One of the key expectations from this task was dynamic question loading and a polished user interface.

To begin with, I created a separate JSON file containing a list of questions, their options, and the correct answers. This made the application scalable — allowing easy addition or removal of questions in the future. The JavaScript part of the project used the `fetch()` API to load this JSON dynamically when the quiz starts. Once the data was loaded, questions were presented one at a time, and users were required to select their answer. The app provided instant feedback by changing the color of selected options — green for correct and red for incorrect — giving users a clear understanding of their performance in real-time.

The interface was styled to mimic a Netflix-inspired theme with a dark background and red highlights. I used modern CSS techniques like Flexbox for layout and responsive styling to make the quiz usable on both desktop and mobile devices. I also added a score tracker and a “Next” button that appeared only after an answer was selected, improving user experience and guiding them step-by-step.

Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript fundamentals including DOM manipulation, event listeners, arrays, functions, and the importance of code modularity. I also became more comfortable writing clean and readable HTML/CSS and using external files for data. This project reinforced my problem-solving skills, especially in debugging click events and managing UI state during transitions between questions.

In conclusion, Task 1 was a great introduction to dynamic front-end applications without the need for any libraries or frameworks. It served as a foundation for understanding user interaction logic and helped me improve both my technical and design skills. The final product is a responsive, visually engaging quiz app that showcases essential front-end capabilities.
